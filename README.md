# Integrated-Phishing-Analysis-and-Data-Security-Toolkit
**Project: Integrated Phishing Analysis and Data Security Toolkit**
---

**Objective:**
---
To integrate CyberChef, VirusTotal, and John the Ripper to analyze phishing emails and secure data handling by identifying phishing attacks, testing the strength of password hashes, and generating comprehensive reports for mitigation strategies.

**Project Overview:**
---
Phishing attacks are one of the most prevalent cybersecurity threats. In this project, the goal was to build a toolkit that would analyze phishing-related data, including email attachments, URLs, and password hashes. The toolkit incorporates three main tools:

- CyberChef: For decoding and analyzing encoded data found in phishing email attachments or URLs.
- VirusTotal: To scan and analyze URLs or files for phishing and malware indicators.
- John the Ripper: For testing the strength of password hashes derived from phishing attacks.
  
**Steps & Commands:**
---
**1.Using CyberChef for Data Analysis**

- Goal: Decode Base64 and other obfuscated content to uncover malicious payloads.
Commands:
  - Upload the suspicious file or URL to CyberChef.
  - Use the "From Base64" operation to decode Base64-encoded data.
  - Explore other operations such as "From Hex," "From URL Encoding," etc., depending on the encoding type.
    
Example:

```From Base64 > To Hex > From Hex > To ASCII```

**2. Using VirusTotal for URL and File Analysis**

- Goal: Analyze suspicious URLs or files for phishing and malware indicators.
Commands:

  - Go to VirusTotal’s website and upload suspicious files or paste URLs.
  - Review the analysis results for phishing indicators or malware signatures.
  - Generate a report from the VirusTotal interface.
  - 
**3. Using John the Ripper for Password Hash Strength Testing**

- Goal: Test password hash strength obtained from phishing attacks.
Commands:

  - Download the hashed password file.
  - Run John the Ripper against the password hash:
    
   ``` john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hashes.txt```
  
  - Use additional options for more complex hash cracking, such as using different hash algorithms:
    
  ```john --format=raw-md5 hashes.txt```
  
**Report:**
---
**Findings:**

- Phishing Analysis: Successfully decoded several phishing-related email attachments and URLs, revealing malicious payloads that included Trojan horse scripts.
- VirusTotal: Identified multiple suspicious files and URLs flagged for phishing and malware. Key insights were provided in the report, helping mitigate potential attacks.
- Password Hashes: Discovered weak password hashes in phishing attacks. The hash cracking with John the Ripper revealed commonly used passwords, stressing the importance of strong password policies.
  
**Risks Identified:**

- Unencoded malicious scripts in phishing email attachments.
- Use of easily guessable passwords (e.g., "123456").
  
**Mitigations:**

- Encourage users to avoid clicking on unknown URLs and attachments.
- Implement a more robust password policy requiring longer, complex passwords.
- Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security.
  
**Conclusion:**
---
This project successfully demonstrated how to combine different cybersecurity tools—CyberChef, VirusTotal, and John the Ripper—into an integrated toolkit for phishing analysis and secure data handling. The toolkit not only helps in identifying phishing attempts but also in testing password strength and generating actionable mitigation strategies. By using this toolkit, organizations can strengthen their defenses against phishing attacks and other common security threats.
